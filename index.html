	<p>Japan is so different from other countries that as soon as you step off the plane, you plunge into a kind of nirvana.</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Climate</li>
	</ul>
	
	<P>Japan is located on the Japanese archipelago, consisting of almost 7 thousand islands, the 4 largest of which are: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku. Japan has a humid maritime climate, with the exception of the island of Hokkaido, which has cold, snowy winters and warm summers.</p>
	
	<p>In Japan, mainly dominated by mountain forests, they cover more than 60% of the country's territory. Japan is located in a seismically active zone, so earthquakes occur quite often here. In total, there are about 200 volcanoes, of which about 40 are active. Another natural hazard is typhoons that come to Japan from the Pacific Ocean.</p>
